# Sentiment Analysis on Restaurant Reviews

## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze customer reviews of restaurants to determine the sentiment expressed in them. By leveraging natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques, the model classifies reviews as positive, negative, or neutral. This analysis can help restaurant owners understand customer satisfaction and improve their services.

## Features

- Text preprocessing (tokenization, stop-word removal, stemming/lemmatization)
- Sentiment classification using various machine learning models
- Performance evaluation using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- Visualization of data distribution and model performance

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project consists of restaurant reviews . Each review is labeled with a sentiment (positive or negative). You can use publicly available datasets or collect your own data.

## Preprocessing

- **Text Cleaning**: Remove HTML tags, special characters, and unnecessary whitespace.
- **Tokenization**: Split text into individual words (tokens).
- **Stop-word Removal**: Remove common words that do not contribute to sentiment (e.g., "and", "the", "is").
- **Stemming/Lemmatization**: Reduce words to their base or root form.

## Model Training

Several machine learning models were trained and evaluated, including:

- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting
- Naive bayes Classifier

The models were trained on the preprocessed text data, and hyperparameters were tuned for optimal performance.

## Evaluation

The models were evaluated using the following metrics:

- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score

Confusion matrices and classification reports were generated to provide a detailed performance analysis.
